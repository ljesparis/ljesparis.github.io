            <h1>Hello, dear guest ü´° </h1>
			<p>
                If you've made it this far, it's because you want to know more about me. Which I think is pretty cool =). I'm a <strong>passionate software developer</strong> whose main interest is my personal and professional growth (I'm on the right way üî•). 
			</p>
			<p>
                So far I have worked with companies that have a pretty decent amount of traffic, which is <strong>awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è</strong> and allows me to further develop my technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>Please be welcome to follow me on <u>github</u> or connect with me on <u>LinkedIn</u> üòâ.</p>
