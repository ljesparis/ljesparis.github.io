			<p>
                If you've made it this far, it's because you want to know more about me. Which I think is pretty cool =). I'm a <strong>passionate software developer</strong> whose main interest is my personal and professional growth. I think I'm on my way. 
			</p>
			<p>
                So far I've worked with companies that have a pretty decent amount of traffic, which is <strong>awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è </strong>. As the years have gone by, it's been so exciting to get feedback on my features so quickly, so I can improve my code, my skills, among other things. The coolest thing is working with people who know so much and being able to learn from them.
            </p>
            <p>Please be welcome to follow me on github or connect with me on LinkedIn üòâ</p>
