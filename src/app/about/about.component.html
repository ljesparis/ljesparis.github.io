    Hi! if you've come this far, it's because you want to know more about me (which is cool btw).
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a backend developer who likes to learn about technology and participate in the development of things.
    So far I have worked in very good companies, where code quality was not the most important thing and yet I
    have learned a lot. I am still focused on improving the quality of my code and applying good practices.
